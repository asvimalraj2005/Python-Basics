# The ord() function returns the ASCII code of the character and the chr() function returns character represented by a ASCII number
#
# ORD() and CHR() are mainly used in DSA for conversion purposes 
#
# Below is the example where we are converting string character into number
ch='C'
print(ord(ch))
#
#
# Below is the example where we are converting ASCII value which is a number that is associated with the character 
print(chr(65))
#
Alphabet=65
print(chr(Alphabet))
